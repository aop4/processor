# zombies
A computer game programmed in MIPS assembly language. The player moves about in a Pac-Man-like maze of simulated LED lights filled with "zombies" that chase the player. Graphics were implemented through an extension for the MARS IDE developed by graduate students at the University of Pittsburgh.
