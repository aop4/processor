# Single-Cycle Processor
A single-cycle processor design capable of executing a 16-bit reduced instruction set. I designed and tested it using Logisim software.
Executable instructions include memory storage and retrieval, conditional branching (to other instructions in the machine language 
instructions), unconditional jumps to specified instructions, loading registers with immediate values, basic bitwise logic operations 
and shifts, basic mathematical operations (including addition with immediates), and halting the processor.

The program used to generate machine-language instructions from assembly language instructions (to test the processor) and the simplified 
assembly language the processor implements are not my own.
